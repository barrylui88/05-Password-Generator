# Password-Generator

## Description 

This webpage contains code for a webpage that can generate a customised password based on criteria specified by the user through various prompts. I have written the additional JavaScript code to fulfil the requirements as well as making some very slight HTML and CSS updates to provide more guidance to the user. It has been a great opportunity for me to apply the knowledge learned over the last week to instruct the computer to carry out instructions following inputs from the user.

Following this task, I've certainly enhanced my skills to utilise JavaScript and the relevant methods to build this password generator. I went above and beyond by increasing the randomness of the password by ensuring that the order in which the character types were appearing were completely random, therefore reducing the likelihood of any brute force password cracking.
